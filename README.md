# Three Amigos

## Background

### Traffic Signals
* Purpose
* Meaning of Traffic
* Traffic Signal Controllers
* Urban Traffic Control Systems

### Signal Types and Signal Aspects
* Aspects, Signal Colour, and Signal Meaning
* Signal Types and Aspect Counts
* Filter, Indicative, and Sign Aspects
* Flashing Aspects

### Phases
* Traffic Movements
* Phases
* Conflicting Phases
* Minimum Green Signal Durations
* Intergreens

### Stages and Dummy Phases
* Grouping of Phases
* Signal Timing Plans
* All-Red Dummy Phases

### Cycles, Splits, Offsets, and Co-ordination
* Cyclical Nature of Signal Timing Plans
* Sharing Cycle Period Between Movements
* Co-ordinating Signals Between Sites and Traffic Platooning

### Detectors and Optimisation
* Variability of Demand
* Inadequacy of Fixed Signal Timings
* Detection of Traffic Demand
* Detection of Traffic Volume
* Detector Types (Induction, Infrared, Radar, Image Recognition)

## What we're aiming to build
* Traffic Signal Controller Software and Interfaces to Signalling Hardware and Detectors
* Tools for Configuring Traffic Signal Controller Software Instances
* Tools for Developing and Validating Signal Timing Plans
* Mechanisms for Monitoring and Co-ordinating Signal Timings Between Sites
* Mechanisms for Monitoring and Co-ordinating Signal Timings With a Central System
